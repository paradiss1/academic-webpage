abstract: Increases of water turbidity and suspended sediment transport in submarine
  canyons have been associated with high-energy events such as storms, river floods
  and dense shelf water cascading (DSWC), and occasionally with bottom trawling along
  canyon flanks and rims. To assess the variations on the water column turbidity and
  sediment transport in the Palamós Canyon linked to both natural and trawling-induced
  processes, an autonomous hydrographic profiler, as well as a near-bottom current
  meter and a turbidimeter were deployed in the canyon axis (929 m depth) from February
  to June 2017, covering a trawling closure (February) and trawling activities (March-June).
  Periods of enhanced water turbidity during the trawling closure were mostly associated
  with storms and DSWC events, transporting turbid dense waters into the canyon. In
  absence of such events, the water column displayed low suspended sediment concentrations
  (~ 0.3 mg L− 1) until the trawling season began, when particulate matter detachments,
  ranging between > 1 mg L− 1 and 3.8 mg L− 1, were observed at the water depths where
  the trawling grounds are found. During the trawling closure, high near-bottom suspended
  sediment fluxes (35–44 g m− 2 s− 1) were sporadically registered at ~  920 m depth
  associated with a major storm and DSWC event. Smaller but more frequent increases
  of near-bottom suspended sediment fluxes (0.1–1.4 g m− 2 s− 1) were recorded during
  trawling activities. Despite these smaller trawling-induced suspended sediment fluxes,
  30 days of continuous bottom trawling activity transported a total amount of 40
  kg m− 2, of similar magnitude to that generated by a major DSWC event (50 kg m− 2).
  Since bottom trawling in Palamós Canyon is practiced on a daily basis throughout
  the year, a much larger contribution of anthropogenically derived water turbidity
  and suspended sediment transport can be expected.
