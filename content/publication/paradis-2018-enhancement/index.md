abstract: Commercial bottom trawling causes some of the largest impacts on the sea
  floor, and it has been identified as one of the major drivers of sediment resuspension
  on continental slope regions, particularly in areas surrounding submarine canyons.
  To assess whether there have been significant trawling-induced alterations in the
  sediment dynamics within the Foix Canyon (Northwestern Mediterranean) during the
  past century, sediment accumulation rates obtained using 210Pb and 137Cs radiochronology
  were compared between sediment cores retrieved in 1993 and in 2013 from the canyon
  axis at 860 m depth. The results indicate an almost two-fold increase in the sedimentation
  rate in the 1960–70s, from 0.5 cm·y−1 to 0.9 cm·y−1, as a consequence of the rapid
  industrialization of the fishing sector at that time. Sedimentation rates further
  doubled to 1.8 cm·y−1 in the early 2000s. This period was characterized by the construction
  of bigger trawlers with more powerful engines as well as the modernization of the
  engines of existing vessels, all of which were largely under-declared. These results
  provide compelling evidence of the increasing impact of bottom trawling due to the
  modernization of trawling fleets at the beginning of the XXIst century.
