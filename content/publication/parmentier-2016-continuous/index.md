abstract: This work describes for the first time a continuous process for selective
  metal extraction with an ionic liquid (IL) at room temperature. The hydrophobic
  fatty acid based IL tetraoctylphosphonium oleate ([P8888][oleate]) was specifically
  chosen for its low viscosity and high selectivity towards transition metals. Applying
  [P8888][oleate] for continuous metal ion extraction with 0.1 M sodium oxalate for
  regeneration resulted in a process with good and stable extraction efficiencies
  over time. The selectivity of the IL resulted in a process in which cobalt was selectively
  removed from two mixed salt solutions (Co/Na, Ca/Co/K) to obtain a pure cobalt stream
  after stripping the IL. The performed experiments showed that the contact time of
  the IL for extraction and stripping strongly influenced the achieved efficiencies.
  The stability of the IL was tested and it was shown that the fatty acid based IL
  was stable for the duration of the experiment. Liposome tests showed that the IL
  is very hydrophobic, which limits its leakage towards the water phase, but also
  results in a higher toxicity towards cell membranes. Economic analysis shows that
  the IL based process is not (yet) economical compared to ion-exchange resins, in
  case demineralised water is the only product. However, if the recovery of valuable
  metals is also taken into account and/or if brine disposal is an issue, then continuous
  IL metal extraction systems must be regarded as promising alternatives.
