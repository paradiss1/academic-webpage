abstract: Bottom trawling grounds have been expanding to deeper areas of the oceans
  since the mid-XXth century, and mitigating strategies aimed to protect fish stocks,
  such as temporal trawling closures, have recently been implemented. Here we investigated
  the biogeochemical properties of sediment from a deep-sea trawling ground in Palamós
  Canyon (NW Mediterranean) to assess the effects of a 2-months trawling closure in
  the recovery of sedimentary organic matter. In comparison to untrawled areas, the
  continuous erosion and sediment mixing in trawling grounds led to coarser reworked
  sediments impoverished in organic carbon (∼30% loss) and promoted the degradation
  of labile compounds (52–70% loss). These impacts persisted after the temporal trawling
  closure, highlighting that this management strategy is insufficient to restore the
  seafloor. Considering the continuous expansion of bottom trawling grounds, this
  activity could have significant and irreversible biogeochemical impacts on ocean
  margins at a global scale, hampering their carbon burial capacity.
