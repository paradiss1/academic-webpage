abstract: Continental margins are transitional areas between the land and the deep
  ocean where large amounts of particulate matter are supplied, transported, and ultimately
  deposited in the deep sea. High-energy hydrodynamic processes such as storms, ocean
  currents, or internal waves and tides, as well as bottom trawling activities contribute
  to the resuspension and remobilization of these particles. These mechanisms favor
  their transference from the continental shelf to the continental slope and maintain
  high concentrations of particulate matter in the water column forming nepheloid
  layers. The temporal evolution of the hydrographic and nepheloid structure in the
  upper slope off Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada, NE Pacific) was assessed
  by analyzing 4 months (from mid-August to late-November 2018) of sensor data from
  Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) NEPTUNE cabled seafloor observatory. The distribution
  of particulate matter during the study period illustrated a well-defined turbidity
  structure consisting of surface nepheloid layers (SNLs) at <100 m depth associated
  to primary and secondary productivity, intermediate nepheloid layers (INLs) between
  150 and 300 m depth at the shelf-break and upper slope domain, and bottom nepheloid
  layers (BNLs) developed at >400 m depth. Moderate storm events occurred during fall
  when the more intense INLs were recorded at shelf-break depths. However, not all
  the INLs recorded during this period occurred in coincidence with these storms,
  indicating that these INL detachments were modulated by a different sediment resuspension
  mechanism. Analyses of fishing vessel activity during the study period revealed
  that trawlers operated over the same depth range as these INLs. Our results suggest
  that, in combination with the regional currents, the presence of continuous fishing
  along the continental slope off Vancouver Island contributes to the advection of
  suspended sediment particles, playing a major role in their transfer as nepheloid
  layers.
