abstract: The disturbance of the marine sedimentary environments by commercial bottom
  trawling is a matter of concern. The direct physical effects of this fishing technique
  include scraping and ploughing of the seabed and increases of the near -bottom water
  turbidity by sediment resuspension. However, the quantification of the sediment
  that has been resuspended by this anthropogenic activity over the years and has
  been ultimately transferred along and across the margin remains largely unaddressed.
  The analysis of sediment accumulation rates from sediment cores collected along
  the axes of several submarine canyons in the Catalan margin (northwestern Mediterranean)
  has allowed to estimate the contribution of bottom trawling to the present -day
  sediment dynamics. 210Pb chronologies, occasionally supported by 137Cs dating, indicate
  a rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates since the 1960-70s, along with a
  strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Such
  increase has been associated to the enhanced delivery of sediment resuspended by
  trawlers from shelf and upper slope trawling grounds towards submarine canyons,
  as a consequence of the rapid technical development at that time, in terms of engine
  power and gear size. This change has been observed in La Fonera (or Palam6s) Canyon
  (one of the most prominent canyons of the region) at depths greater than 1700 m,
  while in other canyons not so deeply incised it is restricted to shallower regions
  (-1000 m in depth) closer to fishing grounds. Two sampling sites from La Fonera
  and Foix submarine canyons that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0.6-0.7
  cm y-1) were revisited several years after the first chronological analyses. These
  two new cores revealed a second and even more significant increase of sediment accumulation
  rates in both canyons which occurred circa 2000 and reached values higher than 2
  cm y-1. This second change at the beginning of the 21st century has been attributed
  to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards slope fishing grounds
  surrounding submarine canyons, and to new technical improvements in trawling vessels,
  presumably related to subsidies and aids provided by the European Commission to
  the fishing industry.
