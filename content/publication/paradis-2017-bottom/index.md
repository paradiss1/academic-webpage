abstract: Many studies highlight that fish trawling activities cause seafloor erosion,
  but the assessment of the remobilization of surface sediments and its relocation
  is still not well documented. These impacts were examined along the flanks and axes
  of three headless submarine canyons incised on the Barcelona continental margin,
  where trawling fleets have been operating for decades. Trawled grounds along canyon
  flanks presented eroded and highly reworked surface sediments resulting from the
  passage of heavy trawling gear. Sedimentation rates on the upper canyon axes tripled
  and quadrupled its natural (i.e. pre-industrialization) values after a substantial
  increase in total horsepower of the operating trawling fleets between 1960 s and
  1970 s. These impacts affected the upper canyon reaches next to fishing grounds,
  where sediment resuspended by trawling can be transported towards the canyon axes.
  This study highlights that bottom trawling has the capacity to alter natural sedimentary
  environments by promoting sediment-starved canyon flanks, and by enhancing sedimentation
  rates along the contiguous axes, independently of canyons’ morphology. Considering
  the global mechanisation and offshore expansion of bottom trawling fisheries since
  the mid-20th century, these sedimentary alterations may occur in many trawled canyons
  worldwide, with further ecological impacts on the trophic status of these non-resilient
  benthic communities.
