abstract: 'Marine sediments play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by acting
  as the ultimate sink of both terrestrial and marine organic carbon. To understand
  the spatiotemporal variability in the content, sources, and dynamics of organic
  carbon in marine sediments, a curated and harmonized database of organic carbon
  and associated parameters is needed, which has prompted the development of the Modern
  Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon (MOSAIC) database (http://mosaic.ethz.ch/,
  last access: 26 July 2023; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8322094, Paradis, 2023;
  https://doi.org/10.5168/mosaic019.1, Van der Voort et al., 2019​​​​​​​). MOSAIC
  version 2.0 has expanded the spatiotemporal coverage of the original database by
  >400 % and now holds data from more than 21 000 individual sediment cores from different
  continental margins on a global scale. Additional variables have also been incorporated
  into MOSAIC v.2.0 that are crucial to interpret the quantity, origin, and age of
  organic carbon in marine sediments globally. Sedimentological parameters (e.g. grain
  size fractions and mineral surface area) help understand the effect of hydrodynamic
  sorting and mineral protection on the distribution of organic carbon, while molecular
  biomarker signatures (e.g. lignin phenols, fatty acids, and alkanes) can help constrain
  the specific origin of organic matter. MOSAIC v.2.0 also stores data on specific
  sediment and molecular fractions, which provide further insight into the processes
  that affect the degradation and ageing of organic carbon in marine sediments. Data
  included within MOSAIC are continuously expanding, and version control will allow
  users to benefit from updated versions while ensuring reproducibility of their findings.'
