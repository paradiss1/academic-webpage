abstract: Bottom trawling in the deep sea is one of the main drivers of sediment resuspension,
  eroding the seafloor and altering the content and composition of sedimentary organic
  matter (OM). The physical and biogeochemical impacts of bottom trawling were studied
  on the continental slope of the Gulf of Castellammare, Sicily (southwestern Mediterranean),
  through the analysis of two triplicate sediment cores collected at trawled and untrawled
  sites (∼550 m water depth) during the summer of 2016. Geochemical and sedimentological
  parameters (excess 210Pb, excess 234Th, 137Cs, dry bulk density, and grain size),
  elemental (organic carbon and nitrogen) and biochemical composition of sedimentary
  OM (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids), as well as its freshness (phytopigments) and
  degradation rates were determined in both coring locations. The untrawled site had
  a sedimentation rate of 0.15 cm yr−1 and presented a 6 cm thick surface mixed layer
  that contained siltier sediment with low excess 210Pb concentrations, possibly resulting
  from the resuspension, posterior advection, and eventual deposition of coarser and
  older sediment from adjacent trawling grounds. In contrast, the trawled site was
  eroded and presented compacted century-old sediment highly depleted in OM components,
  which were between 20 % and 60 % lower than those in the untrawled site. However,
  the upper 2 cm of the trawled site consisted of recently accumulated sediments enriched
  in excess 234Th, excess 210Pb, and phytopigments, while OM contents were similar
  to those from the untrawled core. This fresh sediment supported protein turnover
  rates of 0.025 d−1, which doubled those quantified in surface sediments of the untrawled
  site. The enhancement of remineralization rates in surface sediment of the trawled
  site was associated with the arrival of fresh particles on a chronically trawled
  deep-sea region that is generally deprived of OM. We conclude that the detrimental
  effects of bottom trawling can be temporarily and partially abated by the arrival
  of fresh and nutritionally rich OM, which stimulate the response of benthic communities.
  However, these ephemeral deposits are likely to be swiftly eroded due to the high
  trawling frequency over fishing grounds, highlighting the importance of establishing
  science-based management strategies to mitigate the impacts of bottom trawling.
