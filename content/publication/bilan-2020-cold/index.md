abstract: The Blanes Canyon is located in Northwest Mediterranean, and incises the
  Catalan margin. Bottom trawling is a common activity in the area, frequently occurring
  around the canyon rims and flanks, and causing resuspension of a substantial amount
  of sediment within the canyon. The present study is based on the analysis of video
  transects performed with the ROV Liropus 2000 in the Blanes Canyon, between 600
  and 1100 m depth, in order to characterize cold water coral (CWC) communities in
  a region undergoing severe human pressure. Structurally controlled vertical walls
  have been observed to provide suitable habitat for a wide variety of CWCs, forming
  rich communities that are internationally recognised as Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems
  (VMEs). Major communities consisted of the reef-forming species Lophelia pertusa
  and Madrepora oculata, the solitary scleractinian Desmophyllum dianthus and the
  black coral Leiopathes glaberrima. Our findings highlight the importance of deep-sea
  canyons acting as refugia for CWC communities, which however suffer from the indirect
  impacts of fishing activities, such as sediment resuspension and lost fishing gear.
