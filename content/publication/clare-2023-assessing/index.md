abstract: The sequestration of organic carbon in seafloor sediments plays a key role
  in regulating global climate; however, human activities can disturb previously-sequestered
  carbon stocks, potentially reducing the capacity of the ocean to store CO2. Recent
  studies revealed profound seafloor impacts and sedimentary carbon loss due to fishing
  and shipping, yet most other human activities in the ocean have been overlooked.
  Here, we present an assessment of organic carbon disturbance related to the globally-extensive
  subsea telecommunications cable network. Up to 2.82–11.26 Mt of organic carbon worldwide
  has been disturbed as a result of cable burial, in water depths of up to 2000 m.
  While orders of magnitude lower than that disturbed by bottom fishing, it is a non-trivial
  amount that is absent from global budgets. Future offshore developments that disturb
  the seafloor should consider the safeguarding of carbon stocks, across the full
  spectrum of Blue Economy industries.
