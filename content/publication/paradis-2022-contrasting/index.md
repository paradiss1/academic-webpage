abstract: Submarine canyons are important conduits of sediment and organic matter
  to deep-sea environments, mainly during high-energy natural events such as storms,
  river floods, or dense shelf water cascading, but also due to human activities such
  as bottom trawling. The contributions of natural and trawling-induced sediment and
  organic matter inputs into Palamós Canyon (NW Mediterranean) were assessed from
  three instrumented moorings deployed in the axis and northern flank of the canyon
  covering the trawling closure (February) and the trawling season (March-December)
  of 2017. During the trawling closure, large sediment fluxes with high contents of
  labile marine organic matter content were registered in the canyon axis, associated
  to storm resuspension on the shelf that coincided with dense shelf water cascading
  and high surface water productivity. Although no major natural sediment transport
  events occurred during the following spring and summer months, near-daily trawling-induced
  sediment gravity flows were recorded in the northern flank mooring, placed directly
  below a fishing ground, which sometimes reached the canyon axis. Compositionally,
  the organic matter transferred by trawling resuspension was impoverished in the
  most labile biomarkers (fatty acids, amino acids, and dicarboxylic acids) and had
  a high degree of degradation, which was similar to surficial sediment from the adjacent
  fishing ground. Trawling resuspended particles masked the transfer of organic matter
  enriched in labile biomarkers that naturally occur during the quiescent summer months.
  Overall, bottom trawling enhances the magnitude of particle fluxes while modifying
  its organic carbon composition, increasing the re-exposure and transfer of degraded
  organic carbon and potentially affecting benthic communities that rely on the arrival
  of fresh organic matter.
