abstract: Submarine canyons are preferential pathways for transport of particulate
  matter and contaminants from the shelf to the deep sea. The Gulf of Palermo continental
  margin has a very narrow shelf (about 2–3 km wide on average) and is incised by
  several submarine canyons that favour shelf-slope sediment transfer. A sediment
  core collected on the outer shelf and six sediment cores taken at different depths
  along the Oreto, Eleuterio and Anerella submarine canyons were analysed to study
  the transfer and historical record of trace metal contamination in the Gulf of Palermo
  continental margin. Trace metals, major elements, organic carbon and sediment grain
  size were analysed in these cores, which were dated with 210Pb to assess their historical
  compositional evolution since the late 19th century. Hg, Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd content
  increased until the 1970s and 1980s, associated with the increase in urbanization
  and industrial activities in the Palermo area, and Hg was the contaminant that reached
  the highest enrichments. However, the increasing trend of these metals contamination
  was reversed in the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with drastic changes in the terrigenous
  content and grain size of sediments in the canyon axes. These changes occurred when
  bottom trawling fleets expanded to deeper fishing grounds equipped with powerful
  trawlers around the Gulf of Palermo canyon heads and flanks and along the Oreto
  canyon axis. Bottom trawlers have resuspended large amounts of sediment, which have
  been transferred into the canyons since the 1970s and 1980s and have thus increased
  sediment accumulation rates. This resuspended sediment has been mixing with the
  sediment transferred and accumulated along the canyons, diluting and reducing its
  trace metal contamination levels since the expansion of the bottom trawling fleets.
