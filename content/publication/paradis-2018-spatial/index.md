abstract: A detailed study of 15 sediment cores from Blanes Canyon and its immediate
  surroundings (NW Mediterranean Sea) was conducted to compare historic sedimentation
  rates and evaluate the possible impact of bottom-trawling intensification on the
  sedimentary regimes over the past 50 years. The canyon axis and flanks, as well
  as the adjacent open slope, were sampled at water depths ranging from 300 m to 2200 m.
  Grain size, dry bulk density, and 210Pb concentration profiles were measured to
  assess possible changes in sedimentation rates over the last century and their temporal
  and spatial relationship to bottom trawling effort. Sedimentation rates in the upper
  canyon axis (900–1200 m) had the highest rates of 0.9–2.1 cm·yr−1, quantified since
  the 1970s. Farther downcanyon, sedimentation rates increased two to five times after
  the 1970s, from 0.1–0.2 cm·yr−1 to 0.2–0.8 cm·yr−1, which coincides with a rapid
  growth of the total engine power of the fishing fleet operating in the study area.
  The enhanced sedimentation rates occur downslope of the main fishing grounds and
  decrease downcanyon as the distance from trawling grounds increases. These results
  highlight the ability of bottom trawling to resuspend bottom sediments, leading
  to net erosion of the canyon rims and flanks. In turn, large volumes of sediment
  are advected towards the canyon’s interior, ultimately increasing sediment deposition
  along the canyon axis. Natural sedimentation rates at similar along-canyon distance
  from shore in the untrawled continental slope (900–1500 m) and in the lower canyon
  axis (1500–2200 m) are comparable (0.08–0.20 cm·yr−1), suggesting distance from
  coastal sediment sources as the main control on regional sedimentation in deeper
  parts of the margin. While submarine canyons have been regarded as preferential
  cross-margin conduits for sediment dispersal, they can also potentially function
  as modern depocenters for trawling-induced sedimentation.
