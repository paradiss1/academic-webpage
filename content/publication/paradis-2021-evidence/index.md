abstract: Bottom trawling in submarine canyons can affect their natural sedimentation
  rates, but studies addressing this issue are still scarce. In the Gulf of Palermo
  (SW Mediterranean), bottom trawling occurs on the slope around Oreto, Arenella and
  Eleuterio canyons. Analyses of excess 210Pb concentrations and grain size fractions
  in sediment cores from their canyon axes revealed that sedimentation rates and silt
  contents increased in all canyons in the 1980s, due to the expansion of more powerful
  trawlers (>500 HP) to deeper fishing grounds. In Eleuterio and Arenella canyons,
  sedimentation rates increased by an order of magnitude (0.1-1.4 cm·yr-1), whereas
  they increased less (0.1-0.7 cm·yr-1) in Oreto Canyon, since the enhanced trawling-derived
  sediment fluxes into this canyon are affected by sediment resuspension from trawling
  along its axis. Considering the global expansion of bottom trawling, we anticipate
  similar alterations in other trawled canyons, with ecological consequences that
  should be addressed by management strategies.
